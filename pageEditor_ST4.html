                <h2 id="splash">User Profile Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>To implement the user profile page, key HTML tags such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> are used to ensure proper structure
                    and accessibility. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> contains the page's title and navigation links,
                    allowing users to easily access various sections of the profile. The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>
                    tags divide the content into meaningful segments, such as the user's profile, goals, skills, and
                    contact information, improving the organization and readability of the content. The
                    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag is used for the copyright and additional links to enhance the
                    overall user experience.
                </p>
                <p>CSS properties like <code>display: flex</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, and
                    <code>align-items</code> ensure a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, providing
                    a mobile-friendly design. Color schemes and font-family choices are applied to enhance the visual
                    appeal and provide consistency across the page. Background colors, padding, and margin are used
                    effectively to create spacing and improve readability, ensuring a clean and pleasant user interface.
                </p>
                <p>By utilizing these HTML and CSS techniques, the page is designed to be both accessible and visually
                    attractive, enhancing the user experience and providing ease of navigation across the different
                    profile sections.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility has been prioritized in the design of the user profile page. The navigation elements,
                    including <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> links within the profile and menu, are keyboard accessible,
                    allowing users with motor disabilities to easily navigate using keyboard shortcuts. All
                    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements, such as the profile picture and other relevant images, are
                    equipped with <code>alt</code> attributes to ensure that descriptions are provided for screen
                    readers.
                </p>
                <p>Interactive elements, such as buttons for updating profile information or navigation, are clearly
                    labeled with <code>aria-label</code> attributes for proper identification by assistive technologies.
                    The page features a high contrast between text and background to improve visibility for users with
                    visual impairments. Additionally, the page supports text resizing, ensuring readability for all
                    users.</p>
                <p>The structure of the page is semantically correct, with proper use of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements,
                    which contributes to a logical flow of content for screen readers. Lists and descriptions are
                    well-organized using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> , and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                    tags, which aid in clear navigation, especially for dynamic content. The use of ARIA (Accessible
                    Rich Internet Applications) attributes ensures that all interactive and dynamic elements are well
                    understood by users relying on assistive technologies.

            <section>
                <h2 id="volunteer">Sitemap Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The sitemap page is designed using HTML and CSS to visually represent the website's structure, aiding
                    navigation and user experience. The page utilizes <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements to create a
                    structured visual representation of the site's hierarchy, with <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code> elements
                    defining the sections and <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements labeling them. These elements are
                    styled using CSS properties such as <code>fill</code> for color, <code>stroke</code> for outlines,
                    and <code>font-size</code> for readability.</p>
                <p>To enhance visual engagement, animations are applied using <code>@keyframes fade-down</code>,
                    creating a smooth transition effect for elements as they load. CSS properties like
                    <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>text-align</code> ensure proper spacing and
                    readability. The layout is responsive, with a media query
                    (<code>@media screen and (max-width: 1024px)</code>) that adjusts the sitemap's positioning and
                    dimensions for different screen sizes.
                </p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility considerations have been integrated into the sitemap page to ensure usability for all
                    users. The <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements within the SVG include sufficient contrast between the
                    text and background, making it easier to read for users with visual impairments. Additionally, text
                    sizes are appropriately set to maintain readability across different screen resolutions.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>The given HTML structure represents a webpage dedicated to SDG-9: Industry, Innovation, and
                    Infrastructure. It follows a clean and responsive design approach using various HTML elements to
                    organize and display content effectively. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section contains a
                    navigation bar with links to essential pages such as Home, Volunteer, Content, Sitemap, Table,
                    Feedback, and Team. A menu toggle button is provided to control the visibility of the navigation
                    links. The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> section is organized into multiple sections, each focused on
                    different aspects of SDG-9, such as Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure, and the way forward
                    towards achieving the goal.

                    The content of each section is embedded using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements, which load
                    external content from separate HTML files, making it easy to organize and present detailed
                    information without cluttering the main page. For example, the first iframe loads content about
                    'Industry' with a focus on its significance as the backbone of economic growth, while subsequent
                    iframes load related content on 'Innovation,' 'Infrastructure,' and 'Entrepreneurship.'

                    The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> section includes company information, social media links, and an
                    option for users to subscribe to a newsletter for updates. CSS styles such as
                    <code>display: flex</code> are used to create a responsive and user-friendly layout, ensuring that
                    the page adapts to different screen sizes. Additionally, interactive elements such as the sidebar
                    and top-button ensure easy navigation and enhanced user experience across the site.
                </p>


                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p> The website has been designed with accessibility in mind, featuring a navigation system that is
                    fully keyboard-navigable, allowing users with disabilities to easily access various sections. All
                    interactive elements, such as buttons and links, have been provided with descriptive alt text for
                    screen reader compatibility. The sidebar menu and main content sections use clear headings, ensuring
                    that users can easily understand the structure of the page. Additionally, all images within the
                    content and iframes are equipped with alt attributes for screen readers. The page also ensures
                    sufficient color contrast between text and background, improving readability for individuals with
                    visual impairments. </p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
                <p>nsuring a smooth, intuitive user experience across all pages is a constant challenge. Poor
                    navigation, slow load times, or a confusing layout can lead to high bounce rates and lower user
                    satisfaction</p>

                <p>With increasing mobile web traffic, pages must be optimized for various screen sizes. Failing to do
                    so can result in users having difficulty reading, scrolling, or interacting with elements on the
                    page.</p>

                <p>Writing compelling, relevant, and engaging content that resonates with the target audience can be
                    difficult. Users may leave if they don't find the content valuable or interesting.</p>

                <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
                <p>Prioritize simple, clean, and accessible designs. Consistent and clear navigation, fast load times,
                    and intuitive layouts improve user retention and engagement. Always conduct user testing and gather
                    feedback for continuous improvement</p>

                <p>Implement responsive web design principles. Use flexible layouts, scalable images, and CSS media
                    queries to ensure that the page is fully functional and looks great on all devices, especially
                    mobile phones.</p>

                <p>Craft content that is both informative and engaging. Use visuals, bullet points, and headings to
                    break up long paragraphs. Regularly update content to keep it fresh, and ensure it's optimized for
                    the audience's interests and needs.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>The User Profile Page, Sitemap Page, and Content Page have been designed with full adherence to
                    modern web accessibility and usability standards, aligning with WCAG 2.1 guidelines. The pages
                    utilize semantic HTML5 elements like<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to ensure a clear and machine-readable
                    content structure. This approach enhances content discoverability for both users and search engines,
                    ensuring that the structure is logical and consistent across different devices and screen sizes.
                </p>

                <p>For accessibility, we've ensured that images are provided with relevant <code>alt</code> attributes
                    (e.g., <code>alt="Profile Picture"</code> on the User Profile Page) to make the pages fully
                    compatible with screen readers. This enables visually impaired users to understand the context of
                    the images. Furthermore, high-contrast color schemes have been applied, with a focus on readability
                    (e.g., #2c3e50 on a white background on the User Profile Page and Sitemap Page). This ensures that
                    text is easy to read for users with visual impairments.
                </p>

                <p>The Sitemap Page uses proper HTML structure for presenting navigational elements, ensuring clarity
                    with lists and semantic tags for easy interpretation by screen readers. This structure helps users,
                    especially those with visual impairments, to navigate the website efficiently and find the
                    information they need without difficulty.</p>

                <p>On the Content Page (Industry Content Page), appropriate headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) are used to structure the content, allowing users
                    to navigate easily through sections. This hierarchy of headings is crucial for users who rely on
                    screen readers, as it provides a clear outline of the page content. Additionally, bullet points and
                    images have been used to enhance visual clarity while supporting accessibility by breaking up the
                    text and making the page more engaging.</p>
