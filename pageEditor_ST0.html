                <h2 id="splash">Home Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>To implement the SDG 9 awareness page, key HTML tags such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> are used to structure the content and ensure accessibility. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> contains the page's title and navigation links, guiding users through the site, while the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag organizes links for easy navigation. <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags divide the content into meaningful parts, improving readability and organization, and the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag is used for copyright and additional links. CSS properties like <code>display: flex</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, and <code>align-items</code> are used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a mobile-friendly design. The use of <code>background-color</code>, <code>font-family</code>, and <code>color</code> enhances visual aesthetics, while <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> ensure proper spacing between elements, improving readability and user experience. By combining these HTML and CSS techniques, the page achieves a clean, accessible, and visually appealing design.</p>

                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility has been prioritized in the design of the home page. The navigation elements, including the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> links in the menu, are keyboard accessible, ensuring that users with motor disabilities can navigate easily using the keyboard. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements are equipped with <code>alt</code> attributes to provide descriptions for screen readers. Additionally, all interactive buttons, such as the menu toggle, are clearly labeled for assistive technologies using <code>aria-label</code> to ensure proper identification. The page has a high contrast between text and background colors to aid users with visual impairments, and text resizing is supported for better readability. The page structure is semantically correct, with the use of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements, which improve document flow and accessibility for screen readers. The use of proper HTML elements such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tags for lists ensures logical navigation, while the use of <code>aria-describedby</code> for tooltips improves the understanding of dynamic content for assistive technologies.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="volunteer">Table Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The HTML structure is designed to showcase data on the progress of climate action for various countries, specifically targeting the UN Sustainability Goal of Climate Action. Key HTML elements used in this page include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> for defining the page's top section with navigation and logo, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for the menu navigation that allows users to access various sections like Home, Volunteer, and Feedback, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> for the footer containing contact details, social media links, and subscription options. The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element is employed to display structured data about CO2 emissions, renewable energy use, and action plans for each country. Each <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag is utilized to define headers and data cells, while tooltips (<code>data-tooltip</code>) are included for additional information on hover. CSS is used to create a clean and responsive design, using properties like <code>display: flex</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, and <code>align-items</code> for layout management, and <code>progress-bar</code> for visualizing the percentage of renewable energy usage. Styling decisions ensure that the layout adapts to various screen sizes and that key sections like the table and footer are clearly distinguishable and user-friendly.</p>


                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility has been a key consideration in the design of this page. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements include <code>aria-label</code> attributes for social media icons in the footer, ensuring that screen readers can easily identify them. All images are accompanied by <code>alt</code> attributes to provide descriptions for users relying on screen readers. The text contrast between the background and text has been optimized for improved readability, benefiting users with visual impairments. The navigation bar supports keyboard navigation, allowing users with motor disabilities to easily navigate through the menu. Additionally, the page's structure is semantically organized, with proper use of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tags to improve document accessibility and understanding for assistive technologies. The table is properly structured, and tooltips are provided for more context on hover, enhancing usability for all users.</p>

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The given HTML structure represents a webpage dedicated to SDG-9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. It follows a clean and responsive design approach using various HTML elements to organize and display content effectively. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section contains a navigation bar with links to essential pages such as Home, Volunteer, Content, Sitemap, Table, Feedback, and Team. A menu toggle button is provided to control the visibility of the navigation links. The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> section is organized into multiple sections, each focused on different aspects of SDG-9, such as Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure, and the way forward towards achieving the goal.

                        The content of each section is embedded using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements, which load external content from separate HTML files, making it easy to organize and present detailed information without cluttering the main page. For example, the first iframe loads content about 'Industry' with a focus on its significance as the backbone of economic growth, while subsequent iframes load related content on 'Innovation,' 'Infrastructure,' and 'Entrepreneurship.'
                        
                        The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> section includes company information, social media links, and an option for users to subscribe to a newsletter for updates. CSS styles such as <code>display: flex</code> are used to create a responsive and user-friendly layout, ensuring that the page adapts to different screen sizes. Additionally, interactive elements such as the sidebar and top-button ensure easy navigation and enhanced user experience across the site.</p>
                        

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p> The website has been designed with accessibility in mind, featuring a navigation system that is fully keyboard-navigable, allowing users with disabilities to easily access various sections. All interactive elements, such as buttons and links, have been provided with descriptive alt text for screen reader compatibility. The sidebar menu and main content sections use clear headings, ensuring that users can easily understand the structure of the page. Additionally, all images within the content and iframes are equipped with alt attributes for screen readers. The page also ensures sufficient color contrast between text and background, improving readability for individuals with visual impairments. </p>
