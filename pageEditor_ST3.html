                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The given HTML structure represents a webpage dedicated to SDG-9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. It follows a clean and responsive design approach using various HTML elements to organize and display content effectively. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section contains a navigation bar with links to essential pages such as Home, Volunteer, Content, Sitemap, Table, Feedback, and Team. A menu toggle button is provided to control the visibility of the navigation links. The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> section is organized into multiple sections, each focused on different aspects of SDG-9, such as Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure, and the way forward towards achieving the goal.

                        The content of each section is embedded using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements, which load external content from separate HTML files, making it easy to organize and present detailed information without cluttering the main page. For example, the first iframe loads content about 'Industry' with a focus on its significance as the backbone of economic growth, while subsequent iframes load related content on 'Innovation,' 'Infrastructure,' and 'Entrepreneurship.'
                        
                        The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> section includes company information, social media links, and an option for users to subscribe to a newsletter for updates. CSS styles such as <code>display: flex</code> are used to create a responsive and user-friendly layout, ensuring that the page adapts to different screen sizes. Additionally, interactive elements such as the sidebar and top-button ensure easy navigation and enhanced user experience across the site.</p>
                        

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p> The website has been designed with accessibility in mind, featuring a navigation system that is fully keyboard-navigable, allowing users with disabilities to easily access various sections. All interactive elements, such as buttons and links, have been provided with descriptive alt text for screen reader compatibility. The sidebar menu and main content sections use clear headings, ensuring that users can easily understand the structure of the page.

            <section>
                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered. One of the primary issues was ensuring cross-browser compatibility. While the pages rendered correctly in most browsers, minor styling issues were found in Internet Explorer and older versions of Safari. These inconsistencies required additional CSS fixes to maintain a consistent user experience across all platforms.</p>
                
                <p>Another challenge involved optimizing the accessibility features. While basic accessibility was achieved with semantic HTML and alt text for images, ensuring comprehensive keyboard navigation and managing focus for dynamic content (like modals) proved to be more complex. This required additional JavaScript for focus management and ARIA attributes to improve screen reader compatibility, which was beyond the initial scope.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, we encountered issues with optimizing performance for mobile devices. Although the design was initially responsive, some interactive elements (like dropdown menus) didn’t perform as smoothly on touchscreens, requiring adjustments in touch event handling and padding for better touch target sizes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout the process, several valuable learnings were gained. First, the importance of following semantic HTML5 practices became clear, as it significantly enhanced the accessibility of the site. Using <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> elements improved not just accessibility, but also SEO and overall structure.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, incorporating WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines proved crucial. While initially challenging, integrating features like high-contrast color schemes and ensuring keyboard navigation helped create a more inclusive user experience. Implementing ARIA attributes for dynamic content (such as modals) has been a critical takeaway for ensuring screen reader users can access all content.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, optimizing for mobile devices highlighted the importance of touch-friendly design elements. It was a valuable lesson to ensure all interactive components are large enough for users to interact with comfortably on small screens, reinforcing the need for mobile-first design practices.</p>
                
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>The Home, Table, and Content pages were designed with full adherence to modern web accessibility and usability standards, aligning with the WCAG 2.1 guidelines. We utilized semantic HTML5 elements, such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, throughout to ensure clear and machine-readable content structure. Accessibility was prioritized, with <code>alt</code> attributes added to all images (e.g., <code>alt="Business Icon"</code> on the Content page) and high-contrast color schemes (e.g., #2c3e50 on a white background) to enhance readability. Additionally, all interactive elements, including buttons and links, are keyboard-navigable, and sufficient touch targets were ensured through proper padding around clickable areas on the Home page.</p>

                <p>The Table page was designed with proper tabular data presentation in mind, utilizing <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> headers for clarity and proper HTML structure. Furthermore, the Home page’s interactive Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons were optimized for accessibility, ensuring they meet touch target guidelines. No copyrighted content has been used, aside from placeholder images, and all assets are locally hosted, which aligns with ethical publication practices.</p>
                
                <p>While we have taken every measure to ensure compliance, full accessibility also depends on the JavaScript implementation (e.g., modal.js), which should ideally include ARIA attributes for dynamic content to enhance screen reader support. At present, there is a possibility that keyboard focus management for the modal might need further refinement, and we recommend additional testing to ensure seamless navigation.</p>
                
                <p>In conclusion, the pages demonstrate a strong commitment to web accessibility, usability, and ethical standards, though we acknowledge that continued testing and refinement may be needed to achieve full compliance.</p>
