                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>

                        <b>The implementation of the feedback form page utilizes several HTML and CSS techniques that enhance both functionality and design.</b>

                        <p>Key HTML tags such as <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> used to entire feedback section, while <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements are used for user data entry, ensuring that each field is clearly labeled with <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
                        tags for accessibility. The use of the relevent attribute on inputs helps the necessary validation, guiding users to provide essential informations.</p>

                        <p>CSS properties like display, flex, and grid are the pillers to create a responsive layout, allowing the form to adapt to various screen sizes. Styling choices, such as using border, background-color, and hover effects, improve visual feedback, making the form more engaging. 
                        Additionally, the display of error messages styled with distinct colors allowimg users receive immediate feedback on their input, by enhancing the overall user experience. The combination of these techniques results 
                        in a well-structured, accessible, and visually appealing feedback form that effectively captures user input.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                        <p>Accessibility in feedback form implementation is mainly achived through semantic HTML and thoughtful CSS design. Using proper HTML elements like <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> form fields helpes to identify and describe each input, enhancing usability for users with disabilities. 
                        CSS contributes by ensuring that the layout is responsive and visually clear, using sufficient color contrast and focus styles to provide navigation for all users. JavaScript enhances accessibility by providing real-time validation feedback, allowing users to correct errors as they type, which is particularly beneficial 
                        for those relying on keyboard navigation. Additionally, implementing ARIA attributes, such as `aria-invalid` for inputs, communicates the status of form fields to screen readers, ensuring that users are aware of any issues. The combination of these techniques creates an inclusive environment, allowing users of all abilities 
                        to interact with the feedback form effectively and efficiently.</p>

                <h2 id="team">Team Page</h2>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>

                        <p>The "Team" page uses a variety of HTML and CSS techniques to create a well-structured, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience. Semantic HTML is achived through tags like <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, which establish a clear content and improve accessibility. 
                        Each image includes an `alt` attribute for screen readers, enhancing usability <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, elements, which group related content, while anchor tags <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, facilitate navigation to social media profiles.</p>
                        
                        <p>CSS techniques include Flexbox for responsive layout management, allowing elements to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Media queries ensure that styles adjust appropriately for various devices, enhancing mobile usability. Interactive hover effects are achieved using the `:hover` pseudo-class, providing visual feedback that engages users. 
                        Transitions create smooth changes in properties, enhancing the fluidity of interactions. The warm color palette and thoughtful typography choices, including the use of Google Fonts, contribute to a friendly atmosphere and improve readability. Additionally, list styling removes default bullet points for a cleaner presentation 
                        of team member roles. Overall, these techniques work together to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing web page that effectively showcases the team.</p>


                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                        <p>The "Team" page incorporates several accessibility features to ensure an inclusive web experience for all users, including those with disabilities. Semantic HTML elements such as <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, are used to establish a clear content hierarchy, making it easier for screen readers to interpret and navigate the page. Each image 
                        includes an <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code>,  attribute that describes its content, providing essential context for users who rely on screen readers. The use of <code>&lt;tabindex="0"&gt;</code>, on images allows them to be focusable via keyboard navigation, catering to users who cannot use a mouse. Additionally, social media links can benefit from `aria-labels` to provide descriptive text for screen 
                        reader users. The color scheme is designed to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, enhancing readability for users with visual impairments. Media queries are implemented to ensure the layout adapts to various screen sizes, making the page accessible on mobile devices. Furthermore, the consistent use of headings and lists helps break 
                        down content into manageable sections, aiding users with cognitive disabilities. Overall, these techniques work together to create a functional and accessible "Team" page, promoting an equitable web environment for all users.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>

                    <p>During the implementation of the HTML and CSS for the feedback form and team page, several challenges were encountered, particularly in ensuring responsive design across various devices and browsers. Managing multiple media queries proved complex, but adopting a mobile-first approach and using relative units helped streamline the process.
