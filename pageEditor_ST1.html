                <h2 id="splash">Splash Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The splash screen is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Key HTML elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> organize content, while CSS properties like background-image, display: flex, and keyframes create a visually appealing and responsive design. Media queries ensure adaptability across devices, and JavaScript's setTimeout redirects users after 6 seconds. The result is a modern, engaging, and mobile-friendly splash screen.</p>

                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility has been prioritized in the design of the splash screen. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element includes an alt attribute to provide a description for screen readers, ensuring users with visual impairments can understand the logo's purpose. The text and background colors are designed with sufficient contrast to aid readability for users with visual impairments. The use of semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headings and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> for lists ensures a logical structure, improving navigation for screen readers. Additionally, the responsive design, achieved through media queries, supports text resizing and adaptable layouts, enhancing usability across devices and for users with varying needs. These features collectively ensure the splash screen is inclusive and accessible to all users.</p>

CSS is employed to style the page, with a focus on typography and layout. The font family is set to Roboto for body text and Lora for headings, creating a clean and professional look. The page is responsive, with media queries adjusting font sizes, margins, and alignment for smaller screens, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices. Images are centered and scaled appropriately to maintain visual balance. The design emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, making the content easy to consume.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout the development of the Industry Content and Volunteer pages, several challenges were encountered. One of the main challenges was ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout across different screen sizes. While the design was responsive, some elements, such as images and text blocks, required fine-tuning to maintain alignment and readability on smaller devices, particularly mobile phones. This involved adjusting margins, padding, and font sizes using media queries to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>
                
                <p>Another challenge was implementing interactive features, such as the expandable review sections and feedback forms on the Volunteer page. Ensuring smooth functionality for these elements required careful handling of JavaScript events and CSS transitions. Additionally, managing the dynamic content, such as toggling between full and short text in reviews, required testing across multiple browsers to ensure compatibility and performance.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, accessibility posed a significant challenge. While semantic HTML and descriptive alt attributes were used to improve accessibility, ensuring keyboard navigation and focus management for interactive elements like the filter/sort functionality and feedback forms required additional effort. This included adding ARIA attributes and testing with screen readers to ensure all users could interact with the content effectively.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
                <p>The development process provided several valuable learnings. First, the importance of a mobile-first design approach became evident. By prioritizing mobile responsiveness from the start, we were able to create a more adaptable and user-friendly layout that scaled effectively across devices. This approach also highlighted the need for touch-friendly design elements, such as larger buttons and interactive components, to enhance usability on smaller screens.</p>
                
                <p>Another key takeaway was the significance of semantic HTML and accessibility best practices. Using elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> not only improved the structure and SEO of the pages but also made the content more accessible to screen readers. Incorporating ARIA attributes and ensuring keyboard navigation for interactive features further enhanced the inclusivity of the design.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, the process underscored the importance of thorough testing across browsers and devices. Identifying and resolving cross-browser compatibility issues early in the development process helped ensure a consistent experience for all users. These learnings will inform future projects, emphasizing the need for accessibility, responsiveness, and user-centered design from the outset.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>The Industry Content and Volunteer pages were developed with a strong commitment to modern web accessibility and usability standards, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Semantic HTML5 elements, such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, were used extensively to ensure a clear and machine-readable content structure. Accessibility was prioritized, with descriptive alt attributes added to all images (e.g., <code>&lt;alt="Green Spaces"&gt;</code> on the Volunteer page) and high-contrast color schemes (e.g., #504E4D on a light background) to enhance readability for users with visual impairments. Additionally, all interactive elements, including buttons and links, are keyboard-navigable, ensuring accessibility for users who rely on assistive technologies.</p>

                <p>The Industry Content page was designed with a focus on clear and structured information presentation, using headings (<code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>) and lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) to organize content logically. The Volunteer page includes interactive features, such as expandable review sections and feedback forms, which were implemented with accessibility in mind. ARIA attributes were used to improve screen reader compatibility, and sufficient touch targets were ensured through proper padding and sizing of interactive elements, making the page user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
                
                <p>No copyrighted content has been used, and all assets, including images and icons, are either locally hosted or sourced from free repositories, aligning with ethical publication practices. While every effort has been made to ensure compliance, there is room for further refinement in keyboard focus management for dynamic content, such as the expandable review sections and feedback forms on the Volunteer page. Additional testing with screen readers and assistive technologies is recommended to ensure seamless navigation and interaction for all users.</p>
                
                <p>In conclusion, the pages demonstrate a strong commitment to accessibility, usability, and ethical standards. However, continued testing and refinement may be necessary to achieve full compliance and ensure an inclusive experience for all users.</p>
